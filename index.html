            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p>
                I tend to write code that is as simple as possible, so other developers in my team don't get a headache while reading code, I tend to not compromise memory and save as much as possible of it.
                <br>
                This translates also in my website ideas, the creativity I get while writing code is very high so keeping things simple makes up for my attempt to overcomplicate things, this could be arguably my only weakness, through my skills I make up for that, more on the next paragraph!

            <h2>What I do best</h2>
            <p>
                through years of working by myself, switching between startups in part-time and even in small companies, I've had my fair share of work and experienced different environiments.
                <br>
                I can safely say that I am able to easily adapt to any team or work in just a few weeks maximum, I tend to be as compassionate and respectful as possible, you will be amazed by the improvement I can make towards the team and the company.
